## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.

- Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
> Uploaded a Python Notebook with consit of the the practical work done using Linear Regression, ridge and lasso regression Model.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8

## Tools
- Jupyter Notebook
